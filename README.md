# FormatEngine

The FormatEngine gem contains the common support code needed to support
string formatting and parsing routines like strftime and strptime.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'format_engine'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install format_engine

## Usage

```ruby
require 'format_engine'

#Work In Progress

```

## Philosophy

When designing this gem, a concerted effort has been applied to keeping it as
simple as possible. To this end, many subtle programming techniques have been
avoided in favor of simpler, more obvious approaches. This is based on the
observation that I don't trust code that I don't understand and I avoid code
I don't trust.

Feedback on the convenience/clarity balance as well as any other topics are
most welcomed.
