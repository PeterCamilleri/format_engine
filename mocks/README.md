# FormatEngine - The mocks folder.

This is a new idea that is being evaluated. In order to keep code DRY and
encourage proper care and maintenance of mocks and stubs, this folder
will contain those mocks and stubs. The idea is that by making them into
separate entities in their own right, they just might get a little more
respect.

In addition, it may encourage the sharing and increased scrutiny of these
testing tools and thus improve productivity and quality.
